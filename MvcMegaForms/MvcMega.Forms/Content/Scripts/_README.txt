2. Make your edits and save to generate the JS file (ensure there are no errors in the "Error List" tab in VS)
3. Run the website for testing and ensure all scenarios work (TODO: get functional tests working to test all scenarios)
4. Once finished, replace the files in this folder with the ones from WebsiteForTesting
